# Variational-Autoencoder

Use python 3.6 for all parts'




1.1

This is Autoencoder on the CUFS training set.

Run file `Autoencoder.py` providing the correct dataroot folder 

(the root folder should contain another folder inside which will be the actual images)







1.2

This is VAE on the CUFS training set.

Run file `vae_cufs.py` providing the correct dataroot folder 

(the root folder should contain another folder inside which will be the actual images)




1.3

This is VAE on the celeba training set.

Run file `vae_celeba_new.py` providing the correct dataroot folder 

(the root folder should contain another folder inside which will be the actual images)
